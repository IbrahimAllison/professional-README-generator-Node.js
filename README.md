# professional-README-generator

**Description**
The project involves creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquire package.

**Motivation for the Project**
I was curious to know how I can design my own README.md file from scratch. I want to have control of the whole README design by customizing the features and sections of the file. I plan to use the professionally generated README for future projects and challenges.

**What Problem does it solve?**
It makes it easy for developers to understand your codes as well as enable them to know how to use and not use the codes. It is a WIN-WIN for both the code author(s) and the contributors that will use the repository.

**Usage**
The project is aimed at creating a professional README for a new project. The command-line application would accept users input and prompt the user to enter the requested information. After the user enters all the required information. The command-line application would display "Success! Great job! Check out your generatedREADME.md"

**License**
MIT license was used for creating this repository.
