# professional-README-generator

**Description**
The project involves creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquire package.

**Motivation for the Project**
I was curiuos to know how I can design my own README.md file from scratch. I want to have control of the whole README design by customizing the features and sections of the file. I plan to use the professionally generated README for future projects and challenges.

**What Problem does it solve?**
It makes it easy for developers to understand your code and how to use and not use the codes. It is a WIN-WIN for both the code author(s) and the contributors that will use the repository.
